## How to create a main page (example.com/mypage)
To create an 'About' page or any main page (accessible from navigation), create a .md file in your 'content' directory by running the following
```bash
hugo new about.md
```

To create a new section (list page) with descendant content pages, create .md files inside a folder with your section name, Or run the following command

theme = "minimist"
copyright = "Copyright Â© 2018, John Doe; all rights reserved."

googleAnalytics = ""
pluralizeListTitles = false

[params]
    # meta
    author = "John Doe"
    keywords = "front-end,web,javascript,JS,HTML,CSS,development,developer"
    description = "Full stack web deveoper and blogger."
    
    # profile

    enableHomepageBlogBrief = true
    briefSection = "blog" # specify a section to show links from ( "" (blank), will list recent pages from all sections)
    numberOfBriefLinks = 4

    # footer
    showMinimistCredits = true

[[params.navigation]]
# navigation links

## Development

### Development environment setup

`npm start`: To launch a Hugo server using the theme along with the exampleSite content. Thus, Any edits can be performed on the theme root directory.

`npm test`: Runs 'hugo' to build the /public directory and serves it on localhost using Browsersync. Beneficial for testing changes on mobile devices.


### Planned features
Check [project board](https://github.com/mshjri/minimist/projects/1).

###   Navigation bar
The navigation bar uses a simple array that is manually edited in `config.toml`. I originally made it this way to keep it flexible in case of adding external links (subdomains, ..etc). However, this makes more overhead, so it would change in the next releases with better implementation.

### CSS
**BEM**: CSS following a mix of BEM and [ABEM](https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/), except (2-3 specificity levels) on article body elements to give the user more flexibility (eg. writing HTML in markdown files)

**Responsive**: Minimist follows mobile-first design methodology. Thus, everything was designed to look better on mobile screens first, then media queries specify the changes for larger screens.

Media Queries:
- min-height 400px & landscape orientation: mobile on landscape with small height 
- min-width 600px: iPhone landscape and iPad portrait
- min-width 960px: iPad landscape, laptop, desktop screens
- min-width 1600px: Larger desktop screens
